    <h1>Machine Learning Basics</h1>

    <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
    <p>
        Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn
        and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the
        development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>

    <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
    <p>
        In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The model is
        trained on a dataset where the correct answers are known, and it learns to predict
        outputs for new, unseen data.
    </p>

    <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
    <p>
        Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find patterns
        and structures in the data without any prior knowledge of what it should be looking for.
    </p>

    <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
    <p>
        Reinforcement learning is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular
        situation. It employs trial and error to come up with a solution to the problem.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Algorithms</h2>

    <h3>Linear Regression</h3>
    <p>
        Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a
        dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship
        between variables.
    </p>

    <h3>Decision Trees</h3>
    <p>
        Decision trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification
        and regression. The model is constructed as a tree structure where internal nodes represent
        features, branches represent decisions, and leaf nodes represent outcomes.
    </p>
